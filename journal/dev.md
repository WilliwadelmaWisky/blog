# My Developer Journey
<p align="justify">
  I became interested in modding while playing Ark Survival Evolved. I wanted to make a mod myself so I began to search how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod after trial and error. There was actually very little resources on how the dev kit works at the time so I lost interest on it quite quickly. Also the fact that the dev kit ran extremely slowly on my machine encouraged that. Naturally my interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself and my journey as a "game developer" started.

## Starting game development journey with the already familiar Unreal Engine 4

<p align="justify">
  As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day. However my inability to make something visually pleasing in 3D made me begin to lean towards the 2D development. The tooling for 2D in Unreal Engine was quite limited at the time. I had learned a lot of important skills from controlflow to basic script communication so I was confident to be able to use an actual programming language. I started to look for better alternatives for 2D development.

## Moving to Unity Engine

<p align="justify">
  I came across Unity Engine and started to learn how to build something with it. Luckily there was a lot more learning material for Unity than for Unreal, so learning was not an issue. I first needed to learn C# to be able to build something with Unity. It was such a different experience from blueprints in Unreal. Luckily C# syntax was very straight forward so I was able to understand it rather quickly. So I began building different 2D projects to learn the language better. I completely fell in love with C# and its statically typed language syntax. After many attempts to finish a game, I always ended up losing interest in the projects due to the gameplay not being fun enough or the quality of the assets not being eye-pleasing enough. In the end I had a lot of unfinished projects but had learned so much. I decided it was time to try something else than game development. The experience with Unity and C# definitely opened many more doors to learn different languages and frameworks.

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I started my web development journey by making very simple static websites with html and css. I was able to make somewhat eye-pleasing static websites so I thought that maybe I should invest a little more time on learning frontend development. Some time later I began searching on how to render dynamic data on the website and that led me to learn little javascript. Javascript was such a weird language compared to C#. However I was able to understand it enough to make something work. I decided to search a better and easier way.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The search introduced me to typescript which was a lot more familiar looking compared to javascript. I also found out of the many different javascript frameworks and learned about nodejs. The first framework I came across was react. I also heard it was quite popular so I gave it a try. I decided to go with typescript which was definitely a wise decision. A few little projects (todo-app etc.) later I thought react is a little bit unnecessary for my small project ideas. I began searching for another simpler way. I decided to give another framework, called vue, a try because I heard people like it a lot more than react. I started to build a little login/logoff application with vue. Very quickly I realized that, even though I liked vue quite a bit, also vue was a bit unnecessary. I also gave angluar a try but that was even worse for small projects. I decided to move back to vanilla javascript.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Building something simple was a lot better to do than with react or vue for example. However vanilla javascript is a bit tedious and I imagine that is the main reason for choosing to use a framework in the first place. Luckily JQuery came to the rescue. I can keep my small projects very simple and clean from all the boilerplate.

<p align="justify">
  While experimenting with legacy react I noticed it did not work without a server. I needed to create an http server so I started to look for ways to create those. With a quick look on the internet I found that python has a quite simple http server built-in so I tried it. It was very simple to get the server up and running. However I did not like that approach very much due to the nature of python, not my favorite language for said tasks. I began to search a more suitable option for my preferences.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I came across golang. I immediately noticed some familiarity between golang and C# so naturally I was keen to give it a try. Quite quickly I realised golang was a lot better option for me. Setting up an http server was also incredibly simply with golang. A while later I came across flask which is a python web framework and a lot nicer to use than the built-in options. Flask definitely brought python back on my list of possible candidates when building an http server.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  ASP.NET ...
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I also decided to try what java had to offer. Java is very similar to C# so there was not too much to learn about the syntax. I came across a framework called wicket. I did not have any specific project idea in mind so I just did some simple testing how the framework worked. Another framework I discovered was Spring.

## Getting into desktop application development with the web-based technologies

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=E95420)

<p align="justify">
  My first taste of web-based desktop application frameworks was electron. A working application was quite simple to get up and running with electron + javascript. However, in electron, working with a file system, for example, felt a little too complicated to my taste. I decided to search a different and simpler option.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  An option I came across was a framework called Tauri. However the problem with tauri was that I needed to learn Rust. I had a little look on the internet what is this so called Rust language. I found out that it is very fastly evolving language and loved by many. I thought I will probably have to learn it someday anyway so I decided I might as well do it now and began learning rust. Rust was a very different experience from C# or javascript, and I little too complicated and messy to get something actually done. I decided to move away from web-based frameworks.

  Eventually I drfited away from C# to Java once again. Now I have been using Java for developing desktop applications and have not really looked back. I absolutely love to work with JavaFX. But of course I wanted to learn more so could not stop my journey on the JavaFX. I decided to try what kinda frameworks Python has to offer for building desktop applications.

## Giving python a try

<p align="justify">
  I tried building desktop apps with python (with windows). Working with virtual environments was a bit tedious as windows tried really hard to prevent me from using them. Luckily I managed to get it working with few commands. Another problem I faced was running the executables made from the python source code. Running the executables did not go smoothly at all as windows defender just blocks the execution and deletes the file afterwards. I found a lot of similar issues on the internet. Luckily there were a couple of easy fixes for that, either whitelisting the executable or ditching windows entirely. Next up it was time to take on the big challenge and try out C and C++.

<p align="justify">
  I have been reading a little about computer graphics in the form of C++ and OpenGL. I decided that maybe I should try to build something with OpenGL as well. I came across CMake which makes compiling the C++ application very simple. Setting up a simple window was relatively easy to get working with GLFW. Probably the hardest part was to get the OpenGL working on my machine. Nonetheless I began building a very simple raytracer.

<p align="justify">
  Python has very good tools for working with numerics and creating plots or so I heard. I decided to try to learn numpy, scipy and matplotlib for that very reason. I am very glad I did invest a lot of time to learn them because they are getting more and more useful for me everyday. In the past I used quite a bit of excel (well the libreoffice alternative) when I needed to create a plot for some data for example because I did not know any better alternatives. I probably have not touched excel even a single time after learning python and I am very glad about that. It is just a lot faster to work with python and I have way more control over the results. Filled with confidence I decided that I should learn a little about machine learning as well.
