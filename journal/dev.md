# My Developer Journey
<p align="justify">
  I became interested in modding while playing Ark Survival Evolved. I wanted to make a mod myself so I began to search how does one make mods for ARK. I came across Ark Dev Kit, which was powered by Unreal Engine, and managed to make my own mod after trial and error. There was actually very little resources on how the dev kit works at the time so I lost interest on it quite quickly. Also the fact that the dev kit ran extremely slowly on my machine encouraged that. Naturally my interests moved from the dev kit to the Unreal Engine itself and my journey as a "game developer" started.

## Game Development
### Starting with already familiar Unreal Engine 4
![Unreal Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unreal%20Engine-313131?style=for-the-badge&logo=unreal-engine&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  As mentioned already I began to learn Unreal Engine 4 with blueprints. I learned a lot of by making different small projects that never saw the light of day. However my inability to make something visually pleasing in 3D made me begin to lean towards the 2D development. The tooling for 2D in Unreal Engine was quite limited at the time so naturally I started to look for better alternatives.

  I learned a lot of important skills from controlflow to basic script communication. Unreal Engine is definitely one of the

### Moving to Unity Engine

<p align="justify">
  I came across Unity Engine and started to learn how to build something with it. Luckily there was a lot more learning material for Unity than for Unreal, so learning was not an issue. I first needed to learn C# to be able to build something with Unity. It was such a different experience from blueprints in Unreal. Luckily C# syntax was very straight forward so I was able to understand it rather quickly. So I began building different 2D projects to learn the language better. I completely fell in love with C# and its statically typed language syntax. After many attempts to finish a game, I always ended up losing interest in the projects due to the gameplay not being fun enough or the quality of the assets not being eye-pleasing enough. In the end I had a lot of unfinished projects but had learned so much. The experience with Unity and C# definitely opened many doors to learn different languages.

## Web Development

![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

<p align="justify">
  I started my web development journey by making very simple static websites with html and css. Later I began searching on how to render dynamic data on the website and that led me to javascript. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
  The first javascript framework I came across was react. I also heard it was quite popular so I gave it a try. The syntax was a lot different than that of C#, especially with reqular javascript. I decided to go with typescript which was definitely a wise decision. A few little projects todo-app etc. later I thought react is a little bit unnecessary for my small projects. I began searching for another way. I decided to give another framework, called vue, a try because I heard people like it a lot more than react. I started to build a little login/logoff application with vue. Very quickly I realized that, even though I liked vue quite a bit, also vue was a bit unnecessary. I also gave angluar a try but that was even worse for small projects.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I decided to move back to vanilla javascript. Building something simple was a lot better to do than with react or vue for example. However vanilla javascript is a bit tedious and I imagine that is the main reason for choosing to use a framework in the first place. Luckily JQuery came to the rescue. I can keep my small projects very simple and clean from all the boilerplate.

<p align="justify">
  While experimenting with legacy react I needed to create an http server. I started to look for ways to create those. Python had a quite simple http server built-in so I tried it. It was quite simple to get the server up and running. However I did not like that approach very much due to the nature of python, not my favorite language for said tasks. Later I came across flask which is a lot nicer to use.

## Desktop Applications
### Testing the web-based technologies

<p align="justify">
  My first taste of web-based desktop application frameworks was electron. A working application was quite simple to get up and running with electron+javascript. However, in electron, wokring with for example a file system felt a little too complicated to my taste. I decided to search a different option.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  I came across Tauri. However the problem with tauri was that I needed to learn rust. So I decided I would do just that and began learning rust. Rust was a very different experience from C# or javascript, and I little too complicated and messy to get something actually done. I decided to move away from web-based frameworks to java.

  I also tried building desktop apps with python (with windows). However that did not go very smoothly and the reason wasn't even python itself, nor my inability to use it. The problem was the ability to run python applications after making executables of them. I found a lot of similar issues where windows defender blocks the execution and deletes the file afterwards. Luckily there was an easy fix for that, ditching windows entirely.
