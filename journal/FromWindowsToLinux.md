# From Windows to Linux

<p align="justify">
	This article contains a story of my switch from windows 10 to linux. After the end of support for windows 10 was announced I decided it was a time to move on to linux. However the switch happened a little bit earlier than I originally planned. I happened to buy a new laptop from sale that had windows 11 installed on it. I was not going to use it so it was time to install linux.

	There are many linux distributions out there so I had to choose which I wanted to use. I decided to settle on linux mint as my first physical linux machine because I had heard it was a good option for a windows user. Also one of the critical points of my decision to get linux mint was that it was easy to install.

## Linux Mint

	Linux mint is an easy to use well rounded distro for everyday use. It is very suitable for someone coming from windows background. That excatly what I did so I know what I'm talking about. Linux mint has three different versions: Cinnamon, Mate and Xfce. Cinnamon is the most feature rich and heaviest of the three and my personal favorite. Mate is a little bit more traditional styled and more lightweight than cinnamon. Xfce is even lighter than mate so there should be option for everyone.

	Linux mint is ubuntu/debian based, meaning it is very stable and most of the software work out of the box without much of a hassle. Most of the software can be found on ubuntu repositories or from the web as debian installer files. Also mint has a very useful graphical software manager out of the box.

	As I already mentioned linux mint is a very good distribution for someone coming from windows background. Especially cinnamon dekstop feels very similar to windows. Mint also has a big community so answers to most of the problems can be found on the internet straight away. Installing linux mint is very simple and there is a good instructions for doing so.

	I mentioned before of swithing from windows to linux mint which was definitely a good choice for me. I absolutely love the look of the cinnamon desktop and it has so much more customization options than windows. Linux mint is also a lot lighter than windows. Another thing is the updating. I always hated when windows started updating suddenly without any warning when I was doing something else. That completely killed the performance of the computer. There is nothing like that on linux mint, all the updates must be specifically installed with admin priviledges. So linux mint holds a special place in my heart.

	The problem with mint is that many of the software in the official repositories tend to be bit old. So I decided to try out something something from the arch family. It was time to install manjaro for my pc.
</p>

## Manjaro

<p align="justify">
	Manjaro is also quite easy to use operating system, compared to arch anyway and comes in three different official versions: KDE, Xfce and Gnome. I chose KDE because I liked it the best during my tests on a virtual machine.
</p>

<p align="justify">
	Manjaro is based of arch linux so it is not the most stable distro out there. However manjaro makes up for it by having mostly very up to date versions of software. Also, compared to linux mint, manjaro's graphical software manager had a lot more apps.
</p>

<p align="justify">
	There are naturally drawbacks as well. For example I could not get latex to work properly on manjaro. This is of course a quite a small problem and mostly due my limited knowledge. However by googling I found a lot of people having the exact same problem with manjaro/arch. With linux mint latex worked straight out of the box, just needed to install it.
