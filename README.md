# Blog

<p align="justify">
    A collection of articles including for example storytimes, reviews and tutorials. The articles are mostly made without any use in mind so they may contain false or obsolete information. Also the tutorials are mostly made for my own use so I can easily check how something works in case I forget. As such they may not be very beginner friendly. Additionally keep in mind that I am no teacher.
